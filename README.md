# Bless this Mess (FDS Project)
⚠️ STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️ 


This repo contains code and files related to the final project for the course FDS 25/26 @Sapienza for the group _Copia_di_Copia_di_Untitled14_. <br>

Our team's project was an attemp to organize files within a folder. Since folders can easily become the Mess™—especially when collaborating—we felt, after our previous project together, the need for a tool like this.

In this case we worked on text files but in the future we could maybe extend it to code and slides.

### 🌐 Live Demo
You can test the application directly in your browser without any installation: **[Access the Live Demo](https://blessthismess.streamlit.app/)**. <br>
The demo script is in the demo branch.
