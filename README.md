# Bless this mess (FDS Project)
⚠️ STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️ 


This repo contains code and files related to the final project for the course FDS 25/26 @Sapienza for the group _Copia_di_Copia_di_Untitled14_. <br>

Our team's project was an attemp to organize files within a folder. Since folders can easily become the Mess™—especially when collaborating—we felt, after our previous project together, the need for a tool like this.

In this case we worked on text files but in the future we could maybe extend it to code and slides.

This here is a brief illustration of our pipeline: ![Pipeline](https://github.com/WrongMedal/Bless_this_mess-FDS-Project-/blob/main/Pipeline_Screenshot.png)

Further details can be found in our presentation and report.

The full code, instead, can be found here (once I add the links).
