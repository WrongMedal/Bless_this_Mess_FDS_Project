# Bless this Mess (FDS Project)
This repo contains code and files related to the final project for the course FDS 25/26 @Sapienza for the group _Copia_di_Copia_di_Untitled14_. <br>

Our team's project was an attemp to organize files within a folder. Since folders can easily become the Mess™—especially when collaborating—we felt, after our previous project together, the need for a tool like this.

In this case we worked on text files but in the future we could maybe extend it to code and slides.

### Demo
You can test the application directly on your computer with the file demo_app.py [here](https://github.com/WrongMedal/Bless_this_Mess_FDS_Project/blob/main/demo_app.py).
